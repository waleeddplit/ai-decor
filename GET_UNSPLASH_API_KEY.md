## 🆘 Troubleshooting

- Make sure you're logged in
- Go to: https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications
- If you see "Join the API", click it and accept terms

### "My key isn't working"
- Check the `.env` file has no quotes around the key (or use double quotes)
- Restart the backend server
- Check backend logs for "Unsplash" initialization

### "It says 'Rate limit exceeded'"
- You're using a demo key (50/hour limit)
- Switch to production: In Unsplash dashboard, click "Apply for Production"
- Or just keep using demo key for testing (50/hour is plenty for development)
